Here's a basic implementation of a simple blockchain in Python:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport datetime as date\n \nclass Block:\n  def __init__(self, data, previous_hash):\n    self.timestamp = date.datetime.now()\n    self.data = data\n    self.previous_hash = previous_hash\n    self.hash = self.calc_hash()\n \n  def calc_hash(self):\n    sha = hashlib.sha256()\n    hash_str = str(self.timestamp) + str(self.data) + str(self.previous_hash)\n    sha.update(hash_str.encode('utf-8'))\n    return sha.hexdigest()\n \nclass Blockchain:\n  def __init__(self):\n    self.chain = [self.create_genesis_block()]\n \n  def create_genesis_block(self):\n    return Block(\"Genesis Block\", \"0\")\n \n  def add_block(self, data):\n    previous_block = self.chain[-1]\n    previous_hash = previous_block.hash\n    new_block = Block(data, previous_hash)\n    self.chain.append(new_block)\n \nblockchain = Blockchain()\n \nblockchain.add_block(\"First block\")\nblockchain.add_block(\"Second block\")\n \nfor i in range(len(blockchain.chain)):\n  print(\"\\nBlock \", i+1, \":\")\n  print(\"Timestamp: \", blockchain.chain[i].timestamp)\n  print(\"Data: \", blockchain.chain[i].data)\n  print(\"Hash: \", blockchain.chain[i].hash)\n  print(\"Previous hash: \", blockchain.chain[i].previous_hash)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we define `Block` and `Blockchain` classes. Each `Block` object has a timestamp, a data field, a previous hash (which is the hash of the previous block in the chain), and its own hash (which is calculated from the timestamp, data, and previous hash). The `Blockchain` class is responsible for maintaining the chain of blocks, starting with the genesis block.\n\nWe begin by instantiating a `Blockchain` object called `blockchain`, which automatically creates a genesis block. We then add two more blocks to the chain using the `add_block` method, which takes a `data` parameter and uses the hash of the previous block to calculate the hash of the new block.\n\nFinally, we iterate through the `blockchain` object and print out information about each block: its index in the chain, its timestamp, its data, its hash, and the hash of the previous block.\n\nThis is just a basic implementation to get you started. There are many ways you could expand upon this, such as adding proof-of-work or implementing a consensus algorithm.","Role":"assistant"}]
