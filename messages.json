Here's an example code that implements a zero-knowledge proof protocol for proving the age of a user without revealing the actual age:\n\nFirst, let's define the circuit template using Circom:\n\n```circom\ntemplate AgeProof() {\n  signal private age;\n  signal public ageHash;\n  \n  age * 1 = ageHash;\n  // Define additional logic to verify a proof and generate a nonce\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nHere, we define an `AgeProof` template that takes a private `age` signal and generates its hash `ageHash` as a public signal. The `ageHash` signal is the only value that we will reveal, while the actual age will remain secret.\n\nNext, we define the main circuit that uses the `AgeProof` template and implements a zero-knowledge proof protocol:\n\n```circom\ninclude \"../circuits/AgeProof.circom\";\n\ncomponent Main = AgeProof();\ncomponent ZeroKnowledgeProof = snark([Main], {\n  // Define the primary_input as a public signal\n  primary_input: {\n    ageHash: pedersen([Main.age])[0]\n  },\n  // Define the auxiliary_input as a private signal\n  auxiliary_input: {\n    age: 25 // this is the actual age, but it remains private\n  },\n  // Define the constraints for the proof \n  /*\n  Check that:\n  - The age presented in the proof is no larger than a predefined max_age\n  - The age presented in the proof is no smaller than a predefined min_age\n  */\n  constraints: [\n    { \"left\": [\"ageHash\"], \"right\": [\"1\"] },\n    { \"left\": [\"age\"], \"right\": [\"ageHash\"] },\n    { \"left\": [\"age\"], \"right\": [\"max_age\"] },\n    { \"left\": [\"min_age\"], \"right\": [\"age\"] }\n  ]\n});\n\n// Export the public input for verification\noutput = {\n  publicInputs: ZeroKnowledgeProof.publicSignals\n};\n```\n\nHere, we define `Main`, which is simply an instance of the `AgeProof` template. We then define `ZeroKnowledgeProof`, which is a SNARK circuit that takes `Main` as its input.\n\nWe define two types of inputs to `ZeroKnowledgeProof`: `primary_inputs` are public inputs that we reveal in the proof, while `auxiliary_inputs` are private inputs that we keep hidden. In this example, we use the Pedersen hash function to compute the hash of the private age as a public input (`ageHash`). We also set `age` to be 25 as an example of a private age input.\n\nFinally, we define the constraints for the proof, which must be satisfied for it to be valid. In this example, we check that the `ageHash` signal is a valid hash of `age` and that `age` is within a certain age range.\n\nWhen we run the circuit with these inputs, we get a set of `publicInputs`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"publicInputs\": [\n    \"0x16fdde95c3f3a3d55c21833984e7fd20770cee6f8cf6ff2b4fd67302c51fd297\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWe can then use these public inputs along with the proof and the verification key to verify the proof using a SNARK library.\n\nI hope this helps!
