Here is a problem set for a Business Calculus final exam that covers limits, derivatives, integration, and optimization. The markdown includes katex for mathematical notation.\n\n### Problem Set: Business Calculus Final Exam\n\n1. **Limits**\n   - Evaluate the limit: \n\n     $$\\lim_{x\\to 2} \\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$$\n\n   - Determine if the limit exists:\n\n     $$\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} \\frac{e^x}{x^3+3x^2+1}$$\n\n2. **Derivatives**\n   - Find the derivative of the following functions:\n     - $f(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\cdot \\ln(x)$\n     - $g(x) = \\frac{x^4 + 3}{\\cos(x)\\cdot\\sin(x)}$\n   \n   - Find the critical points of the function: \n\n     $$h(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x - 7$$\n\n3. **Integration**\n   - Evaluate the following integrals:\n\n     $$\\int_0^2 (2x^2 - x + 3) dx$$\n     \n     $$\\int \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{1-4x^2}} dx$$\n   \n   - Find the area between $y = x^2$ and $y = 2x$ for $0\\leq x \\leq 2$.\n\n4. **Optimization**\n   - A company produces two products: Product A and Product B. The profit function for each product is as follows:\n\n     $$P_A(x) = 3x^2 + 12x + 10$$\n     $$P_B(x) = 2x^2 + 16x + 15$$\n     \n     The company has a maximum production capacity of 200 units per day. How many units of Product A and Product B should the company manufacture to maximize profit?\n   \n   - A rectangular field is to be enclosed on three sides with a fence. The fourth side of the rectangle will be a wall. If there is a total of 500 feet of fencing available, what is the maximum area that can be enclosed?","Role":"assistant"},{"Content":"Generate the solution to the limits portion and write it in markdown with katex.","Role":"user"},{"Content":"Sure thing! Here are the solutions to the limit problems from the Business Calculus final exam, written in markdown with katex.\n\n### Problem 1: Limits\n\n1. Evaluate the limit: \n\n   $$\\lim_{x\\to 2} \\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$$\n   \n   Solution:\n   \n   We notice that this limit is in an indeterminate form of $0/0$ when $x=2$, so we can't simply substitute $x=2$. Instead, we can factor the numerator and simplify:\n   \n   $$\\lim_{x\\to 2} \\frac{x^2-4}{x-2} = \\lim_{x\\to 2} \\frac{(x+2)(x-2)}{x-2} = \\lim_{x\\to 2} (x+2) = 4$$\n   \n   So, the limit evaluates to $\\boxed{4}$.\n   \n2. Determine if the limit exists:\n\n   $$\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} \\frac{e^x}{x^3+3x^2+1}$$\n   \n   Solution:\n   \n   We can use L'Hopital's Rule to find the limit:\n   \n   $$\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} \\frac{e^x}{x^3+3x^2+1} = \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} \\frac{e^x}{3x^2+6x}$$\n   \n   Applying L'Hopital's Rule again, we get:\n   \n   $$\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} \\frac{e^x}{3x^2+6x} = \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} \\frac{e^x}{6x+6} = \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{e^x}{x+1} = 0$$\n   \n   So, the limit exists and evaluates to $\\boxed{0}$.","Role":"assistant"}]
