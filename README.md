An `end-to-end` project generator.

### Task List

This task list is for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Solus. The MVP will
meet the bare minimum of the requirements listed above and in the specification.
The tasks are being completed according to the [Tracer Bullet Philosophy](https://wiki.c2.com/?TracerBullets)
presented in _[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/320326)_.
The idea is that we will try to slice through the different parts of the project
to provide a simple set of presentable features that can we can continue to
build upon.

Please check our GitHub [Project Page](https://github.com/orgs/CSXL/projects/2) for the task list and roadmap.
